          <h2>App Scoping & Prototype</h2>
          <h4>Bring your best app ideas to life</h4>
          <p>Mobile app prototypes are an invaluable tool for validating a direction before spending big on developing the real-deal app. Our prototypes provide a gorgeous, pixel-perfect experience that follows a few key “happy-path” stories. How we get there is no accident. <br><br>

          Prototyping is particularly valuable in the case of enterprise apps, since these typically require multiple integrations to corporate data sources and platforms. Understanding early-on how the user interactions are going to work, and what data is needed (and when) saves a ton of time and effort when developing/adapting the APIs, web services or point-to-point integrations that will make the app work. In many cases, the development of such integrations can be more costly (both in terms of resources and time) than the development of the app itself.</p>

      <!--    <h2>Testing & QA</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section-6">
          <p>Testing for mobile apps is very different than ‘traditional’ desktop application QA. Many of today’s companies simply aren’t equipped to handle all the specific triage issues unique to the mobile environment. These include Native OS compatibility, memory consumption, offline experience, and device (re)orientation and emulation, to name just a few. Thankfully, these are the kinds of challenges we at Anexinet face every single day. Further, our QA Team is trained not just to test functionality but to analyze approved specs and functional requirements and to inquire further into specific elements where necessary to ensure the app is operating to its fullest potential.<br><br>
          Our QA team then composes use-case scenarios and designs a Test Plan which contains application scope, completion criteria, strategy and coverage, environmental and structural needs, along with task deadlines, risks and contingencies. From here, detailed Test Cases are scripted and executed, and any discovered defects are reported as tickets assigned to development and their progress is tracked to correction. When applicable, app metrics are delivered along with the fix, providing indisputable proof of a repair.<br><br>
          Anexinet’s mobile testing services include:<br>
	· Mobile Testing Strategy<br>
	· Regression Testing<br>
	· System Functional & Non-Functional Testing<br>
	· System Integration Testing<br>
	· Test Automation Strategy, Script Development and Execution<br>
	· User Acceptance Testing<br>
	· UI/UX Testing<br>

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-section-6">
          <p>Manual mobile app testing is time consuming, costly, and insufficient. The vast number of devices, OSs, updates and deployments makes it a losing proposition. Today, automating app regression testing is simply a necessity. For most organizations, however, finding the right mobile-specific testing automation strategy is a challenge. Propelics offers a two-step solution: a Mobile Testing Automation Kickstart followed by an Automated Testing Starter Pack.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-section-6">
          <p>The fact is, mobile possesses considerably more failure-points than typical enterprise web applications, including connectivity considerations, device and OS-specific issues. <br><br>App behavior can be impacted by something as seemingly innocuous as user-settings and preferences or by external forces such as MDM/MAM policy revisions or by the expiration of an app certificate. Further, each app acts as a stand-alone installation and users may install updates inconsistently. To complicate matters, administrators can’t simply remote into user devices to view a problem. And while individual apps may crash, outages—caused by a failure of either integration-services or host-systems—will impact the entire user base.<br><br>To face these many and complex challenges, Anexinet offers enhancement tracking and prioritization along with proactive monitoring and validation of app-store comments, plus in-app feedback management and bug triage tiered for increased efficiency.<br><br>
